## About Me

Hello! My name is Qiuyuan Chen, and I am currently pursuing a Master of Business Analytics at Monash University. I have a strong passion for data analysis and its applications in business decision-making.

### Background and Interests
I am particularly interested in:
- Data analysis and visualization using R Studio and Visual Studio Code.
- Using statistical models to understand business and environmental trends.
- Communicating complex data insights effectively through visualizations.

In this blog, I aim to share my learning experiences and showcase the projects I have worked on throughout the course. Feel free to explore the posts and leave your feedback!
